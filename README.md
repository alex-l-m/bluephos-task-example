Minimal [dplutils](https://github.com/ssec-jhu/dplutils) pipeline to try out generating geometries with [octahedral-embed](https://github.com/alex-l-m/octahedral-embed) and annotating with properties using ASE calculators.
Hopefully the dplutils tasks can then be used in a fork of [bluephos](https://github.com/ssec-jhu/bluephos).
